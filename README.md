# PINNs_LNNs_HNNs
**Created by Imola and Simon for the RL coffee**

Welcome to our **PINNs_LNNs_HNNs** repositoryâ€”an open space for sharing ideas, insights, and experiments related to:
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
- **Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs)**
- **Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs)**

Our goal is to explore and explain scientific machine learning. We encourage open discussion, collaboration, and contributions from anyone interested in applying these advanced neural network frameworks to real-world and theoretical problems.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/PINNs_LNNs_HNNs.git
