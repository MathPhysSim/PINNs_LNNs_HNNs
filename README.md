# PINNs_LNNs_HNNs
Welcome to our PINNs_LNNs_HNNs repositoryâ€”an open space for sharing ideas, insights, and experiments related to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs), and Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs). Feel free to contribute discussions, code, and research findings that push the boundaries of scientific machine learning!
